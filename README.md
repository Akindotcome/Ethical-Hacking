On the broad spectrum of the types of hackers, these types of computer professionals, also known as White-Hats, are the force that protects the data of corporates or companies that employ their services. These certified professionals work with the permission of the system owner to improve security and protect against potential attacks from another malicious specialist generally referred to as Black-Hats.
